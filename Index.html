<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
<p style="margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;">
   I have been interested in IT for many years. Growing up in the 1990s, I witnessed life as we know it undergo a huge
   positive transformation - due to the rapid technological advances taking place all around us. Out of my many magical
   moments of computer related discoveries, the most significant would have to be the advent of music-making software in
   the early 2000s. As a budding young creative, had it not been for the slow and bulky family PC in the corner of our
   lounge room, I would never have had the chance to enter the field of music production, which has (somehow) paid my bills
   for the past ten years. In 2021, I chose to come to RMIT and take some online classes on the topics of IT and
   programming. The “why” for me is very clear - knowing how to utilise the processing power of a computer to solve real
   world problems is a highly valuable skill. What took a little more consideration was the “when”, juggling work and
   family responsibilities. Fortunately the circumstances lined up and allowed me to come back to study, and here I am.

<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
<ul style="margin-right: 5%; text-align:justify;">
  <li>
    Position: Lead Audio Software Engineer is a role that entails several aspects of technology and arts to develop
music-making software for the professional market. I am particularly interested in this role because I have been using
exactly these kinds of software for the last few years for thousands of hours.
  </li>
  <li>
Skills required: Degree in Computer Science, 5 years of experience in developing audio applications, experience working
in a team.
  </li>
  <li>
Current skills: my current skills comfortably cover the relevant areas of songwriting and music production, and could go
as far as product testing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan to obtain skills: complete RMIT degree, start making an effort to learn about this particular industry and what
    I
    can do to get started until I get my qualification, utilise my connections in the music business to build
    relationships
    with people who could help in the employment process.

<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
<ol style="margin-right: 5%; text-align:justify;">
  <li>
    <h4>Meyer-Briggs Test</h4>
    My personality type is ENFT-P, also known as Campaigner. Being a campaigner means I’m outgoing and introspective at
    the same time, thoughtful yet impulsive. Creative and abstract problems drive me and bring out the best in me, while
    discipline and adherence to a fixed path can present challenges. I tend to get consumed with new ideas and
    opportunities. Often others look to me for perspective, for inspiration, for encouragement, and I take on this role
    gratefully. I generally believe in the ability of other people and try to encourage those around me to perform at a
    high level. In my current work as a music producer, having this personality type is what enables me to effectively
    communicate creative ideas to people with varying levels of background knowledge. This personality type lends itself
    to certain roles within a team more than others. I feel comfortable driving ideas, concepts, planning,
    communication. However, I find it difficult to be accountable for organisational aspects of projects, such as
    following a timeline, working towards deadlines, paying attention to the more tedious details of execution. Being
    aware of this natural inclination, I can make more educated decisions when it comes to taking on a role within a
    team. I can see myself making valuable contributions to the design, concept and testing stages of projects. My areas
    of weakness would be in organisation and debugging.

    <h4>Learning Style Test</h4>
    Result - Auditory 55%, Visual 20%, Tactile 25%.
    My learning style as an Auditory learner comes with certain
    particular advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, as implied by the name, I tend to understand things better when I
    hear them out loud or present them to myself in an auditory way rather than visual or tactile. This might be my
    minds way of breaking large chunks of information into smaller bite-sized pieces. Normally I can read and process
    information quite quickly when looking for something in particular or trying to gain an overall understanding of the
    material. However, I lose track of details and often miss important parts by going too fast. That’s why I manage to
    focus more deeply and subsequently retain important information if I hear it rather than read it. This has some
    implications for my usefulness in a team. Developing a solid line of communication plays a crucial role because as
    an Auditory learner I rely on hearing others’ interpretation of a problem to gain a better understanding of it. The
    best way to take this into account when forming a team would be to try and identify team members who I can
    communicate with easily, to take advantage of my style of learning.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Team Roles Test</h4>
    Result - Good interpersonal skills, able to effectively resolve conflict with teammates, good at setting goals. Generally
    enjoy teamwork, although prefer to intersperse it with individual work.
    My interpretation of these results is that I
    would be comfortable working in a team in a professional environment. More specifically, my strengths seem to be
    skewed towards the ideas side than execution. I do well in brainstorming sessions and consider multiple options
    before choosing the best outcome for the group. If conflict arises, I don’t have a problem speaking with all
    concerned parties and calming down the situation. To take this into account when forming a team, I would usually try
    and look to work with people who have complementary skills to mine, ie, stronger leadership qualities, and ability
    to follow detailed timelines.

<h3>Project Idea</h3>
<ul style="margin-right: 5%; text-align:justify;">
  <li>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    This project aims to create a software audio plugin to automate unnecessary and repetitive parts of music
    composition. No “audio” output will be generated by this plugin, rather, only MIDI information, the language
    understood by all music synthesisers. It tells them which notes to play, when to play them, how long to play them
    for, how loud to play them. Furthermore, it will allow users with limited musical background to make creative
    decisions based on the classification of available options by easily graspable labels such as emotion, colour,
    temperature. The MIDI files which will be generated by this plugin can be used to trigger sounds from and
    essentially “play” any synthesiser, both software and hardware alike.
  </li>

    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    Result - Auditory 55%, Visual 20%, Tactile 25%.

    <h4>Description</h4>
    The primary function of this plugin is to enable users to build complex and emotive musical compositions with the
    simple click of a few buttons. Users will input their choices into the plugin, which will generate, display and
    preview the MIDI information in real time. This MIDI information can be exported from the plugin and subsequently
    used to trigger sounds from any synthesiser. I would like to highlight three of the key features which make this
    plugin interesting:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. <i>Jargon-free communication of musical ideas</i>. This plugin will represent commonly used musical “building blocks” as
    more familiar phrases such as “sad”, “happy”, “uplifting”, “suspenseful”, as opposed to the confusing musical
    notation in which these are normally written. In doing so, users with limited knowledge of music theory can simply
    cycle through options generated by the plugin, make decisions based on listening and feeling rather than thinking.
    The intensity of the performance can be increased or decreased by tweaking a knob with labels indicating “cool” on
    one end and “warm” on the other.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. <i>Randomise function.</i> Users will be able to use this feature as an intuitive extension of their natural songwriting
    ability. With a slight nudge in the right direction, this feature can enable the user to audition a large number of
    usable musical idea options in a small amount of time - much faster than would be possible if manually cycling
    through options one by one while noodling on the keyboard, as is usually the way this is done.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. <i> Humanize. </i> One of the biggest drawbacks of digital music composition is that the music can often sound a little
    too “perfect” and “robotic”, as opposed to the more human and natural feeling present in analog recordings of the
    past. The way certain circuits were configured in hardware gear often produced glitches and artefacts that were
    musically pleasing and gave the music an organic aesthetic. This plugin will enable users to control how “perfectly”
    the musical information is performed, and if required, vary the note information around an algorithm designed to
    imitate the natural articulations and mistakes of a human performance.
      </li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li><h4>Tools & Techniques</h4>
    This project doesn’t require any special tools or technologies outside, it can all be designed, coded and tested on
    a personal computer. Many parts of this plugin including the main composition algorithm can be developed without a
    GUI. This will make it easier to focus on the most important part of the project. As a Mac user, I could do this
    project in X Code 4. My research has showed that C++ is the most popular language for coding audio plugins. Many
    developers use JUCE. Since this plugin will only be outputting MIDI data, no additional codecs or system files will
    need to be installed on users’ computers to run this software.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Skills Required</h4>
    Mathematically speaking, music composition is a lot more formulaic than most people realise, given the profound
    emotional and even physical impact of the right sequence of notes at the right time. For any given key / scale
    combination in Western music, there are a finite number of chord sequences which “work”’. These sequences are
    defined by the relative positions of successive and overlapping notes across the subjective musical scale, not their
    objective position as sounds on the frequency spectrum. Also, the same chord progressions that work in one scale can
    be transposed to any other scale with no adjustment, simply shifted up or down exactly as is. In other words, pretty
    much all the music you’ve ever heard, especially pop music, is made up of the same few musical building blocks,
    which can only be played and combined in relatively limited and predictable ways.
  </li>
 <li>
   <h4>Outcome</h4>
   This plugin will enable users with zero musical knowledge to write compelling compositions in a matter of seconds and
   seamlessly incorporate them into any music project they’re working on. It will achieve this by drawing on a bank of
   pre-programmed music theory data, as well as simple algorithms designed to use the power of sorting and randomising
   functions to quickly generate musical phrases.
